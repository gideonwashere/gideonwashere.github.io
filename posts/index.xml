      <description>My GitHub account has become cluttered with many private Git repositories over the years. I have repositories for schoolwork, tutorials, notes for my Dungeons and Dragons campaign; pretty much any text-based project gets put in a Git repository.

Unfortunately, now my GitHub account is covered with private repositories, and logging in to GitHub every time I want to create a repository is a pain.</description>
