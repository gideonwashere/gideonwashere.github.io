# About

Hi! My name is Jake Scott. I'm a professional data analyst, hobbyist programmer, and Linux enthusiast.

I love learning new things especially related to Linux, programming, computer hardware, and math.
I occasionally post here about projects I'm working on, stuff I'm learning about, or just other things I'm interested in at the moment.

If you have any questions, or just want to chat, feel free to email me at: jake@jakesco.com
