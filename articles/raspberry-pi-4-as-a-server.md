# Raspberry Pi 4 as a Home Server
I've been interested in setting up a home server for some time, but was never quite ready to take the plung.
After recieving a Raspberry Pi 4 for my birthday, I thought it would be the prefect oportunity to put some of the networking stuff I've been learning into action.
